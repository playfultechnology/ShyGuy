Knock on the door and a shy character inside will slide back the hatch

This is a simple animated character designed for player interaction in an escape room. It consists of a sliding hatch mounted on a door. When players knock on the door, the hatch slides to the side, revealing a pair of eyes behind.

The knocking is detected by a vibration sensor. The hatch is attached to a carriage that is pulled along a 2020 extruded aluminium beam by a belt around a NEMA17 stepper motor (in much the same way as many belt-driven 3D printers or laser engravers work). The stepper motor is controlled by the driver on an Arduino CNC shield.
